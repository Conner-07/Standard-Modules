# Standard-Modules


#The purpose of this program is to generate a random password using user given arguments. The password and the information about the password will then be gererated and stored in a TXT file. 

The modules and libraries that I utilized in the code include

os- this is important for maintining cros s functionality between operating systems
random - this is important for the randomization of the words and development of the passwords 
string - this is essential for string manipulation
datetime- this is important for assigning the time of origin to the password and enabling the conversion of human readable format for the time of generation
